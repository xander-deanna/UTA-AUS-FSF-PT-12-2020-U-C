# Unit 16: Project 2 Continued

## Overview

You'll continue to collaborate with your fellow developers to create a real-world full-stack application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

At the end of this unit, you and your group will present your application to your fellow students in a group presentation. Because this is a full-stack web application, you and your fellow developers can concentrate on specific aspects of the project in your presentation, following the principle of the separation of concerns.

But while each individual should be able to speak about their contributions, this is still a group project. Be sure to emphasize how the different parts of your application came together and how you worked as a group!

You'll also begin to revise your professional materials, including your portfolio. Don't forget to add your new project to the portfolio once you've completed it!

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Full-stack applications

* Git branching workflow

* Agile software development

* Collaborative development

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Explain agile software development

* Design, build and deploy a full-stack web application to Heroku

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Homework

For this week's homework, you'll update your portfolio page and other professional materials to build towards being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is **still a required assignment**. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is necessary if you're applying for jobs, but it's also critical on your journey as a developer.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about Career Services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [Career Services website](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you'll start working with NoSQL databases using MongoDB. Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your computer **before** starting attending your classes. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB on your computer.

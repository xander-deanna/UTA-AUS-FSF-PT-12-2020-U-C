# üìñ Create a Speed-Reader

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a speed-reading application that prints a single word of a poem at a time. The word should change at the interval provided by the user.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the countdown appears on the screen that indicates the number of seconds remaining before the speed reader begins.

* It's done when, after the countdown ends, the words to the provided poem appear on the screen.

* It's done when the words appear one at a time at the interval provided by the user.

## üìù Notes
